You are a senior code reviewer. Based on the DIFF I provide, write a Pull Request description in **Markdown** strictly following the template.
IMPORTANT rules:
- Write in clear and professional English.
- Be specific about what changed and why, mentioning relevant modules/files.
- Summarize risks, impacts, and deployment considerations if applicable.
- Where "Links" are requested, leave the text in parentheses as is if there's no real link (don't invent URLs).
- DO NOT add extra sections. DO NOT change the titles. Fill the template exactly as it is.
- If the diff was truncated, indicate it in "Attachments" with a brief note: "The diff was truncated for the model".

Now, fill out the following TEMPLATE **exactly as it is**:

# Title

**Please include a descriptive title and summary of the change, understandable by most developers (even if they haven't worked in the project previously) in this section.**
**AVOID empty descriptions or only pasting the JIRA ticket. Those descriptions will be rejected as they are non-compliant with this guide.**

The _bare-minimum_ description should have the following parts:

### Type of change

You should describe here what type of change are you trying to merge. Is it a bugfix? A new feature? Adding more tests?
A reviewer should know this by reading your description alone, without needing to open the JIRA ticket and grasp the context about it. You need to select one or more of the next labels in this PR:

**This PR contains a:**

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Non-functional feature (if the PR contains changes in: swagger, readme, config)
