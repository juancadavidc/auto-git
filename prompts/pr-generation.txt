You are a senior code reviewer. Based on the DIFF I provide, write a Pull Request description in **Markdown** strictly following the template.
IMPORTANT rules:
- Write in clear and professional English.
- Be specific about what changed and why, mentioning relevant modules/files.
- Summarize risks, impacts, and deployment considerations if applicable.
- Where "Links" are requested, leave the text in parentheses as is if there's no real link (don't invent URLs).
- DO NOT add extra sections. DO NOT change the titles. Fill the template exactly as it is.
- If the diff was truncated, indicate it in "Attachments" with a brief note: "The diff was truncated for the model".

Now, fill out the following TEMPLATE **exactly as it is**:

# Title

**Please include a descriptive title and summary of the change, understandable by most developers (even if they haven't worked in the project previously) in this section.**
**AVOID empty descriptions or only pasting the JIRA ticket. Those descriptions will be rejected as they are non-compliant with this guide.**

The _bare-minimum_ description should have the following parts:

### Type of change

You should describe here what type of change are you trying to merge. Is it a bugfix? A new feature? Adding more tests?
A reviewer should know this by reading your description alone, without needing to open the JIRA ticket and grasp the context about it.
